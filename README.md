# Efficient-Hybrid-String-Matching-for-Protien-Sequence-Analysis-using-MAC-algoritham
A hybrid string matching algorithm, MAC (Minimum number of Attempts and Character Comparisons), improves protein sequence analysis by combining Berry-Ravindran and IBS methods. It reduces redundant comparisons, boosting speed and scalability for bioinformatics applications.
